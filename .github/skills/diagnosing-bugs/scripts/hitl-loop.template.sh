# Human-in-the-loop reproduction loop (last resort in phase 1).
# Copy this file, edit the steps below, and run it.
# The agent runs the script; the user follows the prompts in their own terminal.
#
# Usage:
#   bash hitl-loop.template.sh
#
# Two helpers:
#   step "<instruction>"       -> show the instruction, wait for Enter
#   capture VAR "<question>"   -> show the question, read the answer into VAR
#
# At the end the captured values are printed as KEY=VALUE for the agent to parse.
